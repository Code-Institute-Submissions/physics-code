## DESCRIPTION
- **Physics Code** is an educational website aimed at bringing free Physics based content to students and teachers worldwide in a simple and aesthetically pleasing manner. 
The site will be set up to appear more like a textbook, with simple to read pages, large fonts and easy to identify cards. Each card will be presented with labels 
and images to help direct the student to making the correct input for their desired result.

## SITE GOALS
- The website is **informative** allowing users to present information as an educator or as a student, to help prepare for internal assessments, 
essays, mathematical modelling, exams, and other educational needs. Users can:
   - understand the inputs required for a particular calculation 
   - develop their own understanding at their pace of the concepts presented 
   - test themselves on the concept being presented in randomised variable challenges 
   - adapt the information into their own context by using the onboard calculators
- The website is **accessible** to anyone regardless of their level in Phsyics and with some easy navigation can learn and scaffold with the concepts being presented.
 Users can:
   - scaffold their own knowledge by using the navigation plane 
   - apply their curiosity to any of the input fields without the fear of being judged for trying something new or unexpected
   - use any HTML5 enabled browser with JavaScript. There is no special downloads or applications required
   - use unspecialised equipment and will only need a device that can access the internet and display HTML5 based webpages with JavaScript embedded
- The website promotes **curiosity** at a scientific level and allows students to experiment with the calculations to see the outcomes. Users:
   - are guided to input correct data but can choose to go to extremes to "see what happens"
   - will have a help guide to understand what variables they are inputting
- The website provides the world's first online **dilemma zone calculator**. Users will be able to:
   - input velocity, yellow light phase, interphase, reaction time, the coefficient of friction, intersection size, and car length
   - investigate the individual variables and how they are calculated 
   - apply their knowledge to real life situations with detailed context
   - easily get detailed help on each of the variables through various methods including a [help page](https://pauld0051.github.io/physics-code/help.html) 
   and various "tooltips" embedded in question mark icons beside the variables on the calculator 
- The website allows the student to **investigate** all of the variables in a **dilemma zone** calculation for straight line and constant velocity or 
under extreme braking conditions. Users can:
   - investigate their own intersections based on the information given
   - test themselves with randomised and realistic scenarios that allow for extremes on the [test yourself](https://pauld0051.github.io/physics-code/test_yourself.html)
   - explore one of five maps from around the world with a real life intersection and realistic scenarios that allow for extremes
   - refresh scenarios to have nearly unlimited types of randmosied variables that can be calculated using the seven variables in the [calculator](https://pauld0051.github.io/physics-code/calculator.html)
   - attempt to calculate outcomes themselves without the use of the [calculator](https://pauld0051.github.io/physics-code/calculator.html) by following the [help page](https://pauld0051.github.io/physics-code/help.html) page.
- The website provides an interactive **game** that helps the user become aware of their reaction time to help calculate a dilemma zone. Users:
   - can estimate their reaction time at the [game](https://pauld0051.github.io/physics-code/game.html) page 
   - will not need special equipment or any downloads other than a web browser that is capable of reading HTML5 and JavaScript
   - can test their reaction time repeatedly and share their high scores on their Facebook timeline
- The website allows the user to have some input for **future development**.
   - Users of the website are able to [contact](https://pauld0051.github.io/physics-code/contact.html) the author to request new features which can 
   be built into up and coming versions of [Physics Code](https://pauld0051.github.io/physics-code/index.html).

- The website sources map data from **[Google Maps](https://www.google.com/maps/)** making use of Google's Application Programming Interface (API) 
to provide users with highly detailed and specific maps to investigate dilemma zones at real-world intersections.

- The website uses **[MathJax](https://www.mathjax.org/)** an open-source JavaScript display engine for LaTeX, 
MathML, and AsciiMath notation that works in all modern browsers, with built-in support for assistive technology like screen readers.

- The website uses **[Bootstrap libraries](https://getbootstrap.com/)** to provide a responsive website that adapts to the user's devices.
   - allows users to be on mobile, tablet or desktop devices in an array of size dimensions without impacting the user's visual experience

- The website uses **[EmailJS](https://www.emailjs.com/)** to remove the need for backend form filling and allow users to seamlessly send messages to the author.

- As the website develops it is anticipated that:
   - more calculators and help pages will come online 
   - more tests for users will become available based on the new calculators
   - additions to current the dilemma zone calculator to include an optional dilemma zone for perpindicular roads and for non-constant acceleration
   - additional APIs based on the context of the new calculators and could include other reality based principles including climate-change

Solved issues:
1. Make sure no inputs other than numbers and decimal points can be inserted into any field. Using the "number" attribute didn't work as anyone can manually override this
and spinners were removed in the CSS. So a JS isNumberKey(evt) was added that only allows numbers and decimal points. Multiple decimal points can still be added, but the
calculator only picks up the first decimal point. This meant users can not enter incorrect terms into the fields and prevents a NaN return on submit. 
2. Modals will not open when using a button with type="submit". This meant that the "required" attribute could not work in the form as the button type="button" does not 
trigger the "required" attribute in the input tags. Changing the button to type="submit" then meant the modal will not be triggered. To overcome this, some jQuery was
added that allows the modal to operate, as normal, even with a type="submit" button in place. The form needed to have an ID and the modal's ID was parsed into the 
function. 
3. The min="0" and max="1" worked for the coefficient of friction, but required a step="0.001" to allow for decimal places.
4. Adding and removing classes was needed for multiple form inputs. If someone was putting in an input that calculated a delimma zone, the delimma zone icon would 
appear in the modal header. If the user then continued to do another output, and this returned an option zone, they'd see both option zone and delimma zone icons. 
To fix this an add class to bring the icon to the header was used as well as a remove class if one had been added previously. 
5. The dilemma zone calculator works out a dilemma zone as a negative number. But the actual dilemma zone is a positive number as a "size". To remove the negative symbol, 
the Math.abs(total) syntax was tagged onto the function printing out the dilemma zone calculations. 
6. The reaction time game prototype showed that the counter was able to stop and work out the number of seconds the user took to press the "brakes" button. However, the brakes
button remained active and was able to be pushed again. An initial attempt to remove the ID that allows the "click" event to be listened to failed to work. Finally, a jQuery
button disabled function was able to complete the job. 
7. :invalid input alerts on Firefox browsers are not anchored to the input field where users have supplied an incorrect value (for example more than 2 decimal places on calculator.html).
The result is a floating alert box (PICTURED) that detracts from the value of the page. The fix to this is to force the user into using 2 decimal places by javascript.
8. Buttons on the test_yourself.html page are monitored to set the value of the mapNumber in the JS file. However, in doing so, this meant that other buttons on the page 
also affected the mapNumber variable. The fix was to remove the button tag and replace with a span. The span now acts identically to a button but is controlled by CSS. 
There is no user experience difference and users will not be able to notice the difference. 
9. Refactoring 


unsolved problems:
1. After the share to Facebook button is pressed in the Reaction Time game, a link appears on the user account which would go to an approved app. However, for the purposes of
this project, the app has not been approved. The idea of the share to Facebook button was to use API and SDKs from third party sites. The requirement to complete the app for 
Facebook goes beyond the requirement for this site. The issue will only occur externally on Facebook. 
2. Advert blocking apps will cause unnoticed errors with the Facebook share button. Usually no user experience is changed as a result. However, the Console will show 
an ERR_BLOCKED_BY_CLIENT alert and occassionally the Facebook share button may not display at all. The only fix is to turn off ad-blockers. 
3. Some unicode characters would not display on Android mobile devices. A calculator icon was to be used from Fontawesome for the "Calculate" button on the calculator. Due to the nature 
of the code the value could not include a Fontawesome icon. A unicode icon was substituted, however, this was failing to replicate in all devices. Several other unicode variants 
were trialed until a "check mark" x2713 was able to be displayed.

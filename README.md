## DESCRIPTION
- **Physics Code** is an educational website aimed at bringing free Physics based content to students and teachers worldwide in a simple and aesthetically pleasing manner. 
The site will be set up to appear more like a textbook, with simple to read pages, large fonts and easy to identify cards. Each card will be presented with labels 
and images to help direct the student to making the correct input for their desired result.


## SITE GOALS 
[Top](#contents)
- The website is **informative** allowing users to present information as an educator or as a student, to help prepare for internal assessments, 
essays, mathematical modelling, exams, and other educational needs. Users can:
   - understand the inputs required for a particular calculation 
   - develop their own understanding at their pace of the concepts presented 
   - test themselves on the concept being presented in randomised variable challenges 
   - adapt the information into their own context by using the onboard calculators
- The website is **accessible** to anyone regardless of their level in Phsyics and with some easy navigation can learn and scaffold with the concepts being presented.
 Users can:
   - scaffold their own knowledge by using the navigation plane 
   - apply their curiosity to any of the input fields without the fear of being judged for trying something new or unexpected
   - use any HTML5 enabled browser with JavaScript. There is no special downloads or applications required
   - use unspecialised equipment and will only need a device that can access the internet and display HTML5 based webpages with JavaScript embedded
- The website promotes **curiosity** at a scientific level and allows students to experiment with the calculations to see the outcomes. Users:
   - are guided to input correct data but can choose to go to extremes to "see what happens"
   - will have a help guide to understand what variables they are inputting
- The website provides the world's first online **dilemma zone calculator**. Users will be able to:
   - input velocity, yellow light phase, interphase, reaction time, the coefficient of friction, intersection size, and car length
   - investigate the individual variables and how they are calculated 
   - apply their knowledge to real life situations with detailed context
   - easily get detailed help on each of the variables through various methods including a [help page](https://pauld0051.github.io/physics-code/help.html) 
   and various "tooltips" embedded in question mark icons beside the variables on the calculator 
- The website allows the student to **investigate** all of the variables in a **dilemma zone** calculation for straight line and constant velocity or 
under extreme braking conditions. Users can:
   - investigate their own intersections based on the information given
   - test themselves with randomised and realistic scenarios that allow for extremes on the [test yourself](https://pauld0051.github.io/physics-code/test_yourself.html)
   - explore one of five maps from around the world with a real life intersection and realistic scenarios that allow for extremes
   - refresh scenarios to have nearly unlimited types of randmosied variables that can be calculated using the seven variables in the [calculator](https://pauld0051.github.io/physics-code/calculator.html)
   - attempt to calculate outcomes themselves without the use of the [calculator](https://pauld0051.github.io/physics-code/calculator.html) by following the [help page](https://pauld0051.github.io/physics-code/help.html) page.
- The website provides an interactive **game** that helps the user become aware of their reaction time to help calculate a dilemma zone. Users:
   - can estimate their reaction time at the [game](https://pauld0051.github.io/physics-code/game.html) page 
   - will not need special equipment or any downloads other than a web browser that is capable of reading HTML5 and JavaScript
   - can test their reaction time repeatedly and share their high scores on their Facebook timeline
- The website allows the user to have some input for **future development**.
   - Users of the website are able to [contact](https://pauld0051.github.io/physics-code/contact.html) the author to request new features which can 
   be built into up and coming versions of [Physics Code](https://pauld0051.github.io/physics-code/index.html).

- The website sources map data from **[Google Maps](https://www.google.com/maps/)** making use of Google's Application Programming Interface (API) 
to provide users with highly detailed and specific maps to investigate dilemma zones at real-world intersections.

- The website uses **[MathJax](https://www.mathjax.org/)** an open-source JavaScript display engine for LaTeX, 
MathML, and AsciiMath notation that works in all modern browsers, with built-in support for assistive technology like screen readers.

- The website uses **[Bootstrap libraries](https://getbootstrap.com/)** to provide a responsive website that adapts to the user's devices.
   - allows users to be on mobile, tablet or desktop devices in an array of size dimensions without impacting the user's visual experience

- The website uses **[EmailJS](https://www.emailjs.com/)** to remove the need for backend form filling and allow users to seamlessly send messages to the author.

- As the website develops it is anticipated that:
   - more calculators and help pages will come online 
   - more tests for users will become available based on the new calculators
   - additions to current the dilemma zone calculator to include an optional dilemma zone for perpindicular roads and for non-constant acceleration
   - additional APIs based on the context of the new calculators and could include other reality based principles including climate-change

 [Top](#contents)

 - Users who have access to the site via their mobile will be able to navigate to the same pages and have the same overall experience as a 
 user on a tablet or desktop. However, Google Maps measurements are best achieved on desktop and tablets, there is excellent instructions for those 
 using mobile devices to make sure they are not disadvantaged in calculating the dilemma zone on their device.

 - Mobile navigation is made easy with a hamburger drop down menu which pushes content down to display the navigation panel and text;

 [![Physics Code collapsed navigation](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pauld0051/physics-code//master/assets/images/user-stories/mobile-user-collapse-menu.png "Physics Code mobile navigation")](https://pauld0051.github.io/physics-code/index.html)

 ## DISPLAY
 [Top](#contents)

- #### Colour Scheme
[Top](#contents)

  - The site uses light colours to aid those with colour deficiencies which make up over 12% of the world's population
  - The site's colour scheme does not use black text on red backgrounds or strong red over a dark colour
  - The author has mild colour blindness and uses this to make the site accessible for all and checks with colour efficient users for appropriate gradients
  - The navigation bar uses #d7e9f5 as a background colour - a light blue colour that compliments the dark text and highlights the bright red Physics Code icon 
  - The heading boxes of each page are nested in a darker blue compliment to the navigation bar - #54a5d5
  - The background of each heading and subheading box is based on the near white colour #f8f8ff with some opacity to allow for a bold heading or writing to stand out 
  - The actionable content and cards are located on a lighter blue background that compliments both the naviagtion and the headings of the page. The user has 
    a clear understanding that each section is separated from the other. The colour of #b6d5eb is used in all content dis 
  - A rule of thirds is instigated on every page, with a container filling up 67% of the screen width on large screens leaving some white space on either side 
    (approximately 16.2% on each side)
  - Each content container does not take up more than a third of the page before being broken by a heading div on a darker blue background (#54a5d5)
  - The colour scheme remains consistent on smaller devices, but due to limitation of space and for ease of viewing, the white space on each side of the content 
    is much reduced in size and does not obstruct user view 
  - The page flows onto the footer with the same colour as the header's navigation bar of #d7e9f5


- #### Graphics and Images
[Top](#contents)

  - All graphics are small sized png files or jpg with the exception of the icons which are sourced from 
    [Fontawesome](https://fontawesome.com/) and the favicon which is an ico
  - Silouhette images are used on all cards and are primarily single tone black on a white background. With the exception of the two traffic light pictures on the 
    home page which have a red light filled in on one of the images and a yellow light on the other - this does not affect user experience as the cards are specifically 
    labelled 
  - Other card images are sourced from Fontawesome and are coloured black to appear as a Silouhette 
  - The author's charactitures was created in [Bitmoji](https://www.bitmoji.com/) and saved as a png file
  - Card images were sourced from [Flaticon](www.flaticon.com), [Freepik](https://www.freepik.com/), [Clipartlove](https://www.clipartlove.com/) and 
    [Cleanpng](https://www.cleanpng.com/)
  - Edits to the pictures were made in [GIMP](https://www.gimp.org/) which included colouring the traffic lights and flipping images or shading as required 
  - Images are clean, non-confrontational, contextual, add to the user's visual recognition of particular variables and helps provide hints to requirements of the input values
  - Familiar icons are used within buttons and include checkmarks for submit, crosses for close, paper planes for send etc 
  - Question mark icons are used to provide clickable tooltips or links to other pages such as the info button leading to the help page


- #### Fonts and Typography 
[Top](#contents)

  - All headings use the font family Rubik with a fall back of San Serif if Rubik fails to load. Rubik was first discovered at 
    [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Rubik?query=rubik)
  - Headings are all coloured in a dark crimson #85144b and is set as a colour opposite of the darker blue background
  - All paragraph text uses the font family Ubuntu also falling back to Sans Serif should Ubuntu fail to load. The font was first discovered at 
    [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Ubuntu?query=Ubuntu)
  - Fonts were chosen for thier clarity and ease to read even though the font styling was subtly unique but retained boldness and perspicuousness
  - Navbar text uses Raleway and also falls back to Sans Serif should Raleway fail to load. The font was also discovered at 
    [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Raleway?query=Raleway)


- #### Container and Box Structure
[Top](#contents)

  - The site uses the [Bootstrap grid system](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/layout/grid/) to effectively separate each heading division and subsequent subdivision
  - The heading box is lowered slightly from the navigation bar allowing a gap for users to see the structure. Inside each heading box is a rounded off white background 
    containing the heading texts
  - The containers are separated by title boxes and are always followed by content boxes. All content is readable by being placed on the same off white background
  - Box structure is used to separate content, highlight interactive locations and guide the user through easy to follow instructions on site usage
  - Maps on the test yourself page are large sized and easy to manipulate, movable as well as being clickable to see in a full screen on a new broswer tab 
  - The game box takes up considerably more space than the average card to allow for more random patterns for where the brake button will show 
  - The contact-us page uses a large sized form that occupies two thirds of the screen with easy to follow directions
  - Mobile users still enjoy a rule-of-thirds, however, less white space is apparent
  - Overflow is removed from the content so users on any devices, espcially mobile, do not need to scroll left or right for the same visual experience regarless of 
  screen size


- #### Forms and Inputs
[Top](#contents)

  - All forms on the page (contact us in particular) use Bootstrap's [form control](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/components/forms/)
  - Inputs on the calculator and test yourself pages are validated via CSS and turn a pinky red (#c66464) when an invalid input is received 
  - Inputs turn a pale white for contrast with valid inputs (#fbfaf5)
  - Inputs on the calculator page are highlighted and a tooltip presented if an invalid response is given 
  - Inputs on the calculator page with invalid responses are scrolled to automatically on submit 
  - All form fields on the contact us page needs to be completed before submission can occur. Inline text help is given when an incorrect 
    input is completed by a user in one of the fields
  - When users have calculated a scenario on the test yourself page they are prompted to add a value to the input box but are not able to submit 
  this until a number is presented 
  - Users are prompted when an invalid input is recieved and the input box turns pinky red (#c66464) with invalid responses such as non-number input 
  - All forms are validated in HTML using browser validation and complimented with JavaScript validation written by the author

- #### Design Strategy
[Top](#contents)

The overall strategy goals of the webiste design is to produce an easy flowing, uncluttered site but without being too minimal. Removing distractions from the student 
is advantageous for the context of their work while at the same time, large easy to navigate cards allow user input and interaction. This further drives 
the curiosity of the student who can associate images with hints towards the variables required in the calculator or the type of button that they're about 
to press. This helps scaffold the site and differentiate for all users. A beginner in Physics will see the car emblem for instance and recognize this as a kinetic object 
and is prompted by the word velocity. A more seasoned user will instantly see the scientific notation for metres per second and associate the site with SI Units 
even though they will be able to add imperial units in at least two of the calculator inputs. And professional educators will be able to use the site as a 
demonstration or homework assignment for their students or students will be able to model their own data from Google Maps or similar after completing their own 
calculations on the random scenarios. Each page is designed with the same format and layout as the previous page leaving no surprises or the feeling that the user is on 
the wrong page. Any external links are opened in a new browser tab and if the user is on the Calculator page they can access the help page without losing their data. 

The textbook-feel of the site provides a sense of professionalism and trust for the student but without being overwhelming. A seeminlgy difficult task, such as 
calculation of the dilemma zone is made easy by splitting each variable in a logical order for input. The beginner will only require primary data which can be obtained 
easily on the site with default values already input into the calculator. A more seasoned Physics student will want to gather their own data and might further investigate 
reaction times, intersection sizes, phase times for traffic lights and so on, and can then calculate for secondary data. Those who are looking to manipulate the data 
further can adjust scenarios easily and the model allows for a simple single variable change over a large range to allow secondary and tertiary data to be obtained.

The original site design had not included a landing page, this was later added. The first version of the site included only a calculator page. The game and test yourself 
pages were added at the completion of the basic calculation. Site design was regarded as secondary to the functionality to begin with and a simple wireframe model was 
constructed to reflect this. As the JavaScript was completed it was apparent that a more detailed design wireframe was required although the original wireframe allowed for 
a simple design template for each page. New wireframes were made for the game, test yourself and contact pages. The final wireframe to be added was for the landing page 
which was subsequently the last page to be designed and added to the site index. Page design remained consistent and modelled on the wireframes with very little change 
made to the original design. The game page required a considerably larger game pad area to allow for more randomness and excitement in users getting a good representation 
of reaction time. Equations were originally going to be screenshots from an equation editor. However, that never occured and the MathJax libraries were added for the 
[help](https://pauld0051.github.io/physics-code/help.html) page increasing professionalism and clairty of the display.

The main sources for additional content such as API and external libraries were considered in the building of the wireframe. The only APIs to be visible 
on the page were from Google Maps and Facebook. However, emailJS is added as a background functionality. Visible libraries such as [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) 
and [MathJax](https://www.mathjax.org/) were built into the wireframe design. However, it is not clear that MathJax is visible on the help page wireframe and appears as 
substitute text only. 

The coefficient of friction data table was added later and had not been initially considered for the project. An external source was first used, but an alpha-tester 
complained that the data for friction was not readily available to produce accurate calculations. This was remedied with the current table on the 
[Help](https://pauld0051.github.io/physics-code/help.html) and [Test Yourself](https://pauld0051.github.io/physics-code/test_yourself.html) pages. 
The data also better reflected the updated and refactored JavaScript randomised friction generators based on tire quality and weather. 

- API sources that were considered in the wireframes:

  - [Google Maps](https://www.google.com/maps/) used on the [Test Yourself](https://pauld0051.github.io/physics-code/test_yourself.html) page;
    - Five intersections were considered and included for this project
    - Russia - Leningradsky Ave over Tverskaya Zastava Square in [Moscow](https://www.google.com/maps/@55.7769838,37.5835604,81m/data=!3m1!1e3)
    - Australia - Sunnyholt Road at the M7 intersection in [Sydney](https://www.google.com/maps/@-33.7385745,150.9177533,120m/data=!3m1!1e3)
    - United States of America - Lexington Drive over the Harry Byrd Highway in [Ashburn, Virginia](https://www.google.com/maps/@39.0605322,-77.4594559,112m/data=!3m1!1e3)
    - Germany - Sigmundstraße and Leyher Street in [Nürnberg](https://www.google.com/maps/@49.453667,11.0154068,187m/data=!3m1!1e3)
    - Ireland - Constitution Hill at the intersection on Western Way [Dublin](https://www.google.com/maps/@53.3543215,-6.2734058,122m/data=!3m1!1e3)

All maps were considered based on media reports, local knowledge and searching Google Maps for appropriately sized intersections. Intersections were only added if  
certain criteria was met. The intersection needed to be greater than 40 metres in length, have no corners or turns, allowed for unique weather conditions 
(eg ice, snow, heavy rain etc), and were controlled by traffic light signals. Maps also needed to be accessible with satellite view and were clear enough at mobile phone 
size to see the intersection for measurement. 

- Social media share functionality:

  - [Facebook for developers](https://developers.facebook.com/) used on each page and in particular the [Game](https://pauld0051.github.io/physics-code/game.html) page;
    - Each page was to have a share button to Facebook in the footer regardless of the content the page was presenting
    - The share button would default to the [landing](https://pauld0051.github.io/physics-code/index.html) page as a link on the user's timeline
    - An extra share function was built into the [Game](https://pauld0051.github.io/physics-code/game.html) to allow sharing of scores directly to Facebook

Other social media share functionality was also considered, however, Facebook was the only one added in the wireframes and first released version of the site. 
Twitter is likely to be added at a later stage before other social media share buttons.

- Graphical representation of equations:

  - [MathJax](https://www.mathjax.org/) LaTeX mathematical equation builder used on the [Help](https://pauld0051.github.io/physics-code/help.html;
    - Equation display is critical in helping the user understand complex equations 
    - Although images were considered as they can be made fluid, the overall presentation using MathJax was considerably more valuable and useful for site presentation

- Contact ability without backend or server requirements:

  - [EmailJS](https://www.emailjs.com/) is used on the [Contact](https://pauld0051.github.io/physics-code/contact.html) page only;
    - Wireframes are not affected by the use of emailJS

- Responsive display:

  - [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) libraries were used to set up a grid, box and container system 
    - Bootstrap functionality and design is shown in all wireframes

Solved issues:
1. Make sure no inputs other than numbers and decimal points can be inserted into any field. Using the "number" attribute didn't work as anyone can manually override this
and spinners were removed in the CSS. So a JS isNumberKey(evt) was added that only allows numbers and decimal points. Multiple decimal points can still be added, but the
calculator only picks up the first decimal point. This meant users can not enter incorrect terms into the fields and prevents a NaN return on submit. 
2. Modals will not open when using a button with type="submit". This meant that the "required" attribute could not work in the form as the button type="button" does not 
trigger the "required" attribute in the input tags. Changing the button to type="submit" then meant the modal will not be triggered. To overcome this, some jQuery was
added that allows the modal to operate, as normal, even with a type="submit" button in place. The form needed to have an ID and the modal's ID was parsed into the 
function. 
3. The min="0" and max="1" worked for the coefficient of friction, but required a step="0.001" to allow for decimal places.
4. Adding and removing classes was needed for multiple form inputs. If someone was putting in an input that calculated a delimma zone, the delimma zone icon would 
appear in the modal header. If the user then continued to do another output, and this returned an option zone, they'd see both option zone and delimma zone icons. 
To fix this an add class to bring the icon to the header was used as well as a remove class if one had been added previously. 
5. The dilemma zone calculator works out a dilemma zone as a negative number. But the actual dilemma zone is a positive number as a "size". To remove the negative symbol, 
the Math.abs(total) syntax was tagged onto the function printing out the dilemma zone calculations. 
6. The reaction time game prototype showed that the counter was able to stop and work out the number of seconds the user took to press the "brakes" button. However, the brakes
button remained active and was able to be pushed again. An initial attempt to remove the ID that allows the "click" event to be listened to failed to work. Finally, a jQuery
button disabled function was able to complete the job. 
7. :invalid input alerts on Firefox browsers are not anchored to the input field where users have supplied an incorrect value (for example more than 2 decimal places on calculator.html).
The result is a floating alert box (PICTURED) that detracts from the value of the page. The fix to this is to force the user into using 2 decimal places by javascript.
8. Buttons on the test_yourself.html page are monitored to set the value of the mapNumber in the JS file. However, in doing so, this meant that other buttons on the page 
also affected the mapNumber variable. The fix was to remove the button tag and replace with a span. The span now acts identically to a button but is controlled by CSS. 
There is no user experience difference and users will not be able to notice the difference. 
9. Refactoring 


unsolved problems:
1. After the share to Facebook button is pressed in the Reaction Time game, a link appears on the user account which would go to an approved app. However, for the purposes of
this project, the app has not been approved. The idea of the share to Facebook button was to use API and SDKs from third party sites. The requirement to complete the app for 
Facebook goes beyond the requirement for this site. The issue will only occur externally on Facebook. 
2. Advert blocking apps will cause unnoticed errors with the Facebook share button. Usually no user experience is changed as a result. However, the Console will show 
an ERR_BLOCKED_BY_CLIENT alert and occassionally the Facebook share button may not display at all. The only fix is to turn off ad-blockers. 
3. Some unicode characters would not display on Android mobile devices. A calculator icon was to be used from Fontawesome for the "Calculate" button on the calculator. Due to the nature 
of the code the value could not include a Fontawesome icon. A unicode icon was substituted, however, this was failing to replicate in all devices. Several other unicode variants 
were trialed until a "check mark" x2713 was able to be displayed.
